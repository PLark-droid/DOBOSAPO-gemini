## 1. The Reality of Construction Admin (4 min)
- **Slide 4: The "Invisible" Work**
    - It's not just "building". It's the mountain of paperwork behind it.
    - **Specific Tasks**:
        - Daily Reports (日報)
        - Safety Documents (安全書類/グリーンサイト)
        - Photo Management (写真整理/台帳作成)
        - Cost Management (原価管理/出面管理)
        - Equipment/Material Orders (資材発注)
    - **The Pain**: "I'm working late every night just to move data from paper to Excel."
- **Slide 5: The Consequence**
    - Exhausted employees.
    - Managers (Brain) are too busy with "hands" work to think about strategy.
    - "Is this really 'Productivity'?"

## 2. The Solution: Lark & RPA (5 min)
- **Slide 6: What is Lark? (The Body Metaphor)**
    - **Base (Database)** = **The Heart (心臓)**. The pump that holds the lifeblood (Information).
    - **Chat** = **The Blood Vessels (血管)**. Delivering information instantly to where it's needed.
    - **Manager** = **The Brain (脳)**. Making decisions based on fresh, accurate blood (data).
- **Slide 7: What is RPA?**
    - **RPA** = **The Robot Hand**.
    - It takes over the "Brain-Dead" work (脳死作業).
    - Copy-pasting, data entry, file renaming.
    - "Let the robot do the robot's work. Let humans do the human work."
- **Slide 8: Before vs After**
    - **Before**: Information is clogged (Paper/Phone). The Brain is starved. Decisions are slow.
    - **After**: Information flows freely. The Brain is clear. Decisions are instant.
    - **Result**: You don't just "save time". You "regain control".

## 3. Why Now? (2 min)
- **Slide 9: Beyond "DX"**
    - Forget the buzzword "DX". This is about **Survival**.
    - Labor shortage is not coming; it's here.
    - We need a system that allows 1 person to do the work of 3, without burning out.
- **Slide 10: Employee Well-being**
    - When admin work disappears, employees can focus on "Craftsmanship" (Monodzukuri) or get home to their families.
    - That is true "Productivity".

## 4. The Decision & Conclusion (2 min)
- **Slide 11: The Turning Point**
    - Mother's passing. "Life is once."
    - My mission: To bring this "Nervous System" to every construction company.
- **Slide 12: Closing**
    - "Let's build a company where the blood flows and the brain works."
