# Seminar Script: If a Construction Successor Reincarnated as an SE Again

## 0. Introduction (2 min)

**(Slide 1: Title Slide)**
"Hello everyone. Thank you for having me today.
My name is Hiroki Matsui from Sei San Sei Co., Ltd.
Today, I would like to speak to you under the title: 'If a Construction Successor Reincarnated as an SE Again'."

**(Slide 2: Who am I?)**
"First, a brief introduction.
I started my career as a Systems Engineer (SE) in Tokyo after graduating from graduate school. I spent 6 years there, immersed in the world of IT.
Then, I made a U-turn back to my hometown, Hamamatsu, to succeed my father's construction business.
And now? I stand before you not as a construction president, but as a 'Lark Evangelist' at a company called Sei San Sei."

**(Slide 3: The Hook)**
"You might be wondering about the title. 'Reincarnation'?
It sounds like a light novel, but for me, it’s the best way to describe my journey.
I went from the digital world of Tokyo to the analog world of local construction, and now, I'm combining both.
Today, I want to share what happens when you look at our industry through the eyes of an SE, and the powerful tool I found called Lark."

## 1. The Struggle & The Encounter (4 min)

**(Slide 4: Reality of Construction Management)**
"When I returned to Hamamatsu as a successor, I was full of hope. But the reality was harsh.
Paper everywhere. Phone calls for everything. Information scattered across whiteboards, notebooks, and memories.
Despite my IT background, I struggled. I couldn't get the results I wanted as a manager.
I felt helpless. I knew *how* technology could help, but I didn't have the right tool to bridge the gap."

**(Slide 5: Meeting Lark)**
"That's when I met Lark.
It was a shock.
Chat, Documents, Video Conferencing, Approvals, Calendar... everything was in one app.
Usually, you'd buy separate software for each of these. But Lark had it all, seamlessly integrated."

**(Slide 6: Why it Clicked)**
"For me, this was the missing piece.
As an SE, I knew the power of integrated systems. As a construction manager, I knew the pain of disjointed communication.
Lark wasn't just a 'chat tool'. It was a digital nervous system for the company.
I realized: 'This is it. This is what can save us.'"

## 2. The Awakening: BPaaS (4 min)

**(Slide 7: Implementation & Results)**
"I immediately implemented Lark in my father's company.
The change was dramatic.
Information that used to take hours to find was now a search away.
Approvals that took days were done in minutes on a smartphone.
I was so excited that I started posting about it on X (formerly Twitter).
That's when the world started to open up. I connected with other Lark users and eventually became a Lark Partner."

**(Slide 8: What is BPaaS?)**
"Now, I want to introduce a key concept: **BPaaS**.
It stands for **Business Process as a Service**.
It sounds technical, but think of it this way:
It's combining **Lark** with **RPA** (Robotic Process Automation).
It's not just about 'talking' on chat. It's about 'automating' the work.
For example: A site manager sends a daily report on Lark. A robot automatically reads it and updates the Excel ledger. No double entry. No mistakes."

**(Slide 9: Why Construction Needs BPaaS)**
"Why is this important for us?
Because we are facing a massive labor shortage.
We cannot just 'work harder' anymore. We don't have the people.
We must 'work smarter'.
BPaaS is the equalizer. It allows small local companies to have the efficiency of big corporations without the massive cost."

## 3. The Decision (3 min)

**(Slide 10: The Turning Point)**
"As I dove deeper into Lark, something happened that changed my life.
My mother passed away suddenly.
It was a wake-up call.
Her death left me with a profound message: **'Life is once.'** (人生は一度)
I asked myself: 'Am I doing what I truly love? Am I using my life to its fullest?'"

**(Slide 11: The Choice)**
"In September 2025, I made a decision.
I decided to step away from succeeding the family business.
I chose to bet everything on Lark.
Mr. Takahashi, the President of Sei San Sei, whom I met through X, invited me to join him.
I accepted. Because I wanted to dedicate 100% of my passion to this tool that I believe can change our industry."

## 4. Conclusion (2 min)

**(Slide 12: Current Mission)**
"Now, at Sei San Sei, I support various companies.
Real Estate, Scaffolding, Steel, Welfare, Cosmetics...
The industries are different, but the challenge is the same.
Everyone wants to improve. Everyone wants to be more efficient.
And I see Lark transforming them, just like it did for me."

**(Slide 13: Message to Leaders)**
"To all the leaders here today:
Digital is not just a tool. It is a mindset.
You don't need to be an SE like me. You just need the courage to try.
Lark is not difficult. It's designed for people like us."

**(Slide 14: Closing)**
"Let's build the new form of the construction industry together.
If you are interested in how BPaaS can help your company, please talk to me.
Thank you very much."
